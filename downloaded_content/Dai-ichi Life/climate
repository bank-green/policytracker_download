        <h2 class="hdgL _setBase">Issue Awareness</h2>
        <p>The awareness that environmental concerns, climate change in particular, are issues for the international community as a whole has increased with the Paris Agreement going into effect in 2016. The Dai-ichi Life Group, which operates life insurance and asset management businesses globally, also recognizes climate change as an important management issue that could significantly affect the lives and health of its customers, corporate activities, and social sustainability.</p>
        <p>Based on such awareness, we positioned tackling climate change as one of the areas we will continually strengthen in CONNECT 2020<sup>1</sup>, our medium-term management plan, and we are working on a variety of initiatives. Moreover, in addition to boosting management resilience through an assessment of the risks and opportunities posed by climate change, we announced our endorsement of the TCFD<sup>2</sup> Recommendations in September 2018 in order to enhance corporate value through sound dialogue with stakeholders based on such disclosure.</p>

        <h2 class="hdgL _setBase">Stance on Governance/Risk Management</h2>
        <p>The Dai-ichi Life Group practices ERM with the aim of enhancing capital efficiency and corporate value based on strategies that are in accordance with the status of profit, capital, and risk. As a part of this, we identify foreseeable risks that could have a major impact on our business, formulate business plans that take these risks into account, and engage in risk management that responds appropriately to early signs of risk. We treat climate-related risk as a risk with the potential to have a serious impact on the Group in the future due to changes in the environment. The Group ERM Committee, which is composed of the officers responsible for the Risk Management Department and the Corporate Planning Department among others, conducts analysis and assessments, and then reports to the Executive Management Board and the Board of Directors periodically and monitors.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>In addition, Dai-ichi Life undergoes an annual assessment based on PRI<sup>4</sup>, which is the global standard for ESG investment. The initiative policy based on the results of this assessment is discussed at the Responsible Investment Committee, by majority comprised from external experts, and reported to the Executive Management Board to continually upgrade ESG investment.<sup>5</sup></p>

              <p>Dai-ichi Life joined an international initiative that has set a goal of switching to 100% renewable energy from the perspective of promoting increased use of renewable energy to prevent global warming.</p>
              <p class="isSmall">* RE100 (Renewable Energy 100%) was launched in 2014 under the leadership of The Climate Group, an international NGO. It operates in collaboration with CDP (a not-for-profit charity that collects information about action on climate change from businesses and provides it to investors).<br>The target is to procure 100% of the electricity consumed in business activities through renewable energy, and more than 190 of the world's leading companies have joined as of August 2019.</p>

              <p>In 1990, Dai-ichi Life established the Green Environmental Plans Award to support urban greening initiatives. Dai-ichi Life now supports three awards, by adding the Green Cities Award and the Competition for Specialized Greening Technology for Rooftops and Wall Facings. Approximately 200 green spaces have been subsidized up until to 2018. As a result of this initiative, Dai-ichi Life received the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism's Award for Service in Urban Greening in 2000 and 2014.</p>
